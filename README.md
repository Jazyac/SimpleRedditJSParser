# SimpleRedditJSParser


A simple Webpage which parses the top threads of [Reddit's](https://www.reddit.com/) [r/NEWS](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/top/) subreddit, and displays them.

The page is being hosted at [AWARDSPACE](https://www.awardspace.com/) servers, [here](http://jsredditparser.atwebpages.com/).

The [Template(html file and the assets)](https://html5up.net/hyperspace) was downloaded from [html5UP](https://html5up.net/).

The html file was edited slightly to fit my purpose.
